<h1>Course Description</h1>
<p>This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and
running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical
programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible
research and literate programming for data analysis. The target audience
is anyone who wants to do their own data analysis. The course will
culminate with a peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis on either a
pre-specified data set or your data set of choice.</p>

<!-- ## Asynchronous sections -->
<!-- Both sections of this class are fully online, asynchronous. -->
<!-- There are no set meeting times, but assignments still have due dates. Lectures are all pre-recorded and linked from the class website. Students work through the material and complete assignments at their own pace. See [[this page]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/notes/01c_async_protocol.html) for more details on the course format. -->
<div id="course-structure" class="section level2">
<h2>Course structure</h2>
<p>This is a flipped classroom. Before set meeting times, students are
expected to watch the video lectures. Lectures are all pre-recorded and
linked from the class website. During class meeting time, students
complete assignments at their own pace and ask the instructor questions
when needed.</p>

sessions. Bring your computer, coding projects, and your questions to
this open working environment. For asynchronous sections, this is the
best way to get direct instructor assistance.</p>

<h1>Required Materials</h1>
<ul>
<li>A reliable laptop, chromebook, tablet that can use a browser to
access the internet.</li>
<li>Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.</li>
</ul>
<div id="software" class="section level4">
<h4>Software</h4>
<p>If you have your own PC/Mac/*nix computer, you are advised to install
R and R Studio on your personal computer. That way you can take what
you’ve learned in this class and apply it to other classes. Both are
free. Walk through installation instructions can be found here: <a
href="https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/"
class="uri">https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/</a></p>
<ul>
<li>R version 4.3.2 or later. Download from <a
href="https://cran.r-project.org/"
class="uri">https://cran.r-project.org/</a></li>
<li>R Studio version 2023.12.0-369 or later. Download the desktop
version from <a
href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download"
class="uri">https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Students who do not have a computer that they install programs on
(i.e. a iPad or Chromebook) can use the <a
href="https://support.csuchico.edu/TDClient/1984/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=112333">Wildcat
virtual lab</a>, or sign up for R Studio Cloud (<a
href="https://rstudio.cloud/" class="uri">https://rstudio.cloud/</a>).
The free or $5/month plan should be sufficient.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="time-commitment" class="section level1">
<h1>Time Commitment</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the
“credit hour” is defined as … not less than one hour of classroom or
direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class
student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester
or trimester hour of credit.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class
during these 5 weeks. That’s 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of homework
per week. If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with computers,
you may end up taking the entire time. Be sure to schedule sufficient
time during week 5 to work on the project.</p>
<p>You will get out of this class what you put into it. Recall this is
just a co-curriculuar or supplemental basic introductory class. You will
not learn everything there is to know about R, nor likely not feel
proficient by the time you are done. But you will be solidly on the path
where you can continue to learn and improve.</p>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level1">
<h1>Grading</h1>
<p>Credit / No Credit. There are 100 points available in this course.
You must earn <strong>75</strong> points to receive credit for the
course. See Canvas for instructions on how to submit your work and due
dates.</p>
<ul>
<li>Assignments: 4 @ 10 pts each.</li>
<li>Fill out course notes: 7 @ 5 pts each</li>

<h1>Class Policies and statements</h1>

<h2>Everyone is welcome here</h2>
<p>It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students’ learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.</p>
<p>We would like to create a learning environment that supports a
diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your
identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability,
etc.) To help accomplish this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those
that appear in your official Chico records, please let us know!</li>
<li>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and
talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
also submit anonymous feedback (which may lead to a general announcement
to the class, if necessary to address the concerns).</li>
<li>If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the
Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
530-898-4764, and email <a href="mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu"
class="email">diversityoffice@csuchico.edu</a></li>
<li>We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about
diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by
anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it.
(Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Adapted from <a
href="https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements">Monica
Linden at Brown University</a></em>.</p>
<p>We acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that
were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the
Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship
with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through
campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that
since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue
to do so today.</p>

<p>As an instructor, one of my responsibilities is to help create a safe
learning environment on our campus. I also have a mandatory reporting
responsibility related to my role as a your instructor. I am required to
share information regarding sexual misconduct with the University.
Students may speak to someone confidentially by contacting the
Counseling and Wellness Center (898-6345) or Safe Place (898-3030).
Information on campus reporting obligations and other Title IX related
resources are available here: www.csuchico.edu/title-ix.</p>
