\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}

This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and
running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical
programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible
research and literate programming for data analysis. The target audience
is anyone who wants to do their own data analysis. The course will
culminate with a peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis on either a
pre-specified data set or your data set of choice.

\subsection{Course structure}\label{course-structure}

This is a flipped classroom. Before set meeting times, students are
expected to watch the video lectures. Lectures are all pre-recorded and
linked from the class website. During class meeting time, the instructor
will provide brief comments, feedback and guidance, then students
complete assignments at their own pace and ask the instructor questions
when needed. Collaboration with other classmates is encouraged

\subsection{Office Hours}\label{office-hours}

For the first five weeks of the semester (8/25/2025 - 2/21/2025), my
office hours will be in the
\href{https://library.csuchico.edu/innovation-lab}{Meriam Library
Innovation Lab}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Mondays 1pm - 2.30pm
\item
  Tuesdays 1pm - 2.30pm
\item
  Thursdays 11am - 11.50am
\item
  Fridays 2pm - 3.45pm
\end{itemize}

If none of those times work for you,
\href{https://dr-donatello.youcanbook.me/}{use this link} to book an
appointment with me.

\subsection{Canvas Usage}\label{canvas-usage}

All learning content is provided on the course website. Canvas will be
used to submit homework, grades, and friendly reminders to the class.

\subsection{Student Support}\label{student-support}

\subsubsection{Discord}\label{discord}

To facilitate peer to peer and effective instructor to peer assistance
Discord will be used for discussion and questions outside of class. This
server hosts students across multiple Statistics and Data Science
classes, with a specific channel for all sections of Math 130.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Click this link to join the server:
  \url{https://discord.gg/ck497bJty5}
\item
  Verify your email and agree to the rules and code of conduct. This
  helps create a safe learning environment.
\item
  Go to the \texttt{\#class-selection} text channel in the left sidebar,
  and click the RStudio icon emoji under the any post to self-assign you
  to the Math-130 role. This will let you see and access the class
  channels.
\item
  Post a question or 10 to the Math-130 channel.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Community Coding.}\label{community-coding.}

Similar to drop in Mathematics tutoring hours, students, staff, faculty,
and the public are invited to join our Community Coding sessions. Bring
your computer, coding projects, and your questions to this open working
environment. For asynchronous sections, this is the best way to get
direct instructor assistance.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A reliable laptop, chromebook, tablet that can use a browser to access
  the internet.
\item
  Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Software}\label{software}

If you have your own PC/Mac/*nix computer, you are advised to install R
and R Studio on your personal computer. That way you can take what
you've learned in this class and apply it to other classes. Both are
free. Walk through installation instructions can be found here:
\url{https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R version 4.4.1 or later. Download from
  \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}
\item
  R Studio version 2024.12.0 or later. Download the desktop version from
  \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\#download}
\end{itemize}

Students who do not have a computer that they install programs on
(i.e.~a iPad or Chromebook) can use the
\href{https://support.csuchico.edu/TDClient/1984/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=112333}{Wildcat
virtual lab}, or sign up for R Studio Cloud
(\url{https://rstudio.cloud/}). The free or \$5/month plan should be
sufficient.

\section{Time Commitment}\label{time-commitment}

\begin{quote}
For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the
``credit hour'' is defined as \ldots{} not less than one hour of
classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of
out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for
one semester or trimester hour of credit.
\end{quote}

This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class during
these 5 weeks. That's 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of homework per
week. If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with computers, you
may end up taking the entire time. Be sure to schedule sufficient time
during week 5 to work on the project.

You will get out of this class what you put into it. Recall this is just
a co-curriculuar or supplemental basic introductory class. You will not
learn everything there is to know about R, nor likely not feel
proficient by the time you are done. But you will be solidly on the path
where you can continue to learn and improve.

\section{Grading}\label{grading}

Credit / No Credit. There are 100 points available in this course. You
must earn \textbf{75} points to receive credit for the course.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

\section{Class Policies and
statements}\label{class-policies-and-statements}

\subsection{Everyone is welcome here}\label{everyone-is-welcome-here}

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.

We would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity
of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities
(including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To
help accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that
  appear in your official Chico records, please let us know!
\item
  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
  your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
  talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
  also submit anonymous feedback (which may lead to a general
  announcement to the class, if necessary to address the concerns).
\item
  If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office
  of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
  530-898-4764, and email
  \href{mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}{\nolinkurl{diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}}
\item
  We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about
  diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class
  (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about
  it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).
\end{itemize}

\emph{Adapted from
\href{https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements}{Monica
Linden at Brown University}}.

We acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that
were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the
Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship
with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through
campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that
since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue
to do so today.
