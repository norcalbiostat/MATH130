# So you signed up for an asynchronous class

* What does asynchronous mean? 

* How will it work for this class? 

* How do I ...
    - turn in homework
    - talk to the instructor
    - get help
    - see my grade

# What does asynchronous mean?

* No scheduled class times where we meet all together at the same time and place. 

* Self-paced work, but still with due dates.

* More self-regulation on your part to watch the videos and **reach out for help when needed**

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.alt = "a woman confused by math", out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}

```

# Do I have to watch the videos? 

Can't I just google it? 

* You could, but it's easy to get lost as a new language learner. 
* This course was specifically designed to teach new learners specific pieces of how to work with data in R that will lead to success (and less headache) in later classes. 

```{r confusion, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.alt = "a woman confused by math", out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/WRQBXSCnEFJIuxktnw/giphy.gif")
```

* Watching the videos walks you through filling out the course notes, which directly translates to the homework. So you'll end up doing WAY more work if you go the google route.

# Asynchronous $\neq$ no community

It's an overused statement now due to Covid, but we really are all in this together. You are not alone in your learning journey and challenging yourself by learning new things is most effective in a community. 

This is one reason I'm asking you to join Discord for this class. 

* Coding is a social activity!
* Faster response time to get a question answered
* Helping others reinforces your learning - a learning technique not to be undervalued!

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.show = "hold", fig.alt = "Bringing pizza to a firefight now that's Community", out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://media.giphy.com/media/zPOErRpLtHWbm/giphy.gif")

# Asynchronous $\neq$ no instructor!

I'm still here for you! I'm just letting you lead your learning. 

I will have several hours each week specifically dedicated to student help and learning. I am offering additional Zoom office hours during winter break. When class is in session, I am also available to meet you in person at Holt 106. 



## Ways to contact me: 

* Meet with me during my office hours though Zoom or in person
* Discord 
* Email

# Join Discord
This is the defacto method of communication for this class. 


Click this link to join the server: https://discord.gg/ck497bJty5

1. Verify your email and agree to the rules and code of conduct. This helps create a safe learning environment.

2. Go to the `#get-roles` text channel in the left sidebar, choose your pronouns (optional but helpful), and click the RStudio icon emoji under the second post to self-assign you to the Math-130 role. this will let you see and access the class channels! 

3. Post an introduction in the `#class-chat` channel. Tell us a little bit about you (major, hobbies etc) and introduce a favorite pet or book.

# Tips for success

* Set aside specific time during the week as you would any class to work on this material. 

* You get out of this class what you put into it. If you don't try to learn the _why_, you won't be able to do the harder but more important work. 

* Robin's rule - do not spend more than 20 minutes stuck before you ask for help. 

* Find a study buddy. Someone to sit down and work on this material with you.  

* Come hang out in Discord or at Community Coding. Ask all the questions, get all the helps. Seriously, make that your "class" time. Join a voice channel in Discord, a CC zoom room or a room in person and just sit and do your work. That way someone is right there when you have a question. 

* Don't be afraid if you don't know, that's part of the learning process. None of us is born knowing things. Knowledge comes from experience. Period.  

* You CAN'T break R. I promise. The worst that'll happen is that you have to reinstall it. nbd.

# Submitting work for scoring

# Final comments

* Do not skip the videos. Open up the course note to fill out when you are watching the videos. Then work on the homework assignment. 

* Expect a total of at least 50 hours on this course if you are a novice in R. I would recommend 2 hours per day in the morning to make steady progress and not forget what you learn. 

* Be sure to ask me for help when needed. You may also log in to my zoom office hours to work on your homework so that when you have questions, it could be easily solved.
