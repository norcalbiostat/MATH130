# Course Description
This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible research and literate programming for data analysis. The target audience is anyone who wants to do their own data analysis. The course will culminate with a peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis on either a pre-specified data set or your data set of choice.

<!-- ## Asynchronous sections -->
<!-- Both sections of this class are fully online, asynchronous. -->
<!-- There are no set meeting times, but assignments still have due dates. Lectures are all pre-recorded and linked from the class website. Students work through the material and complete assignments at their own pace. See [[this page]](https://norcalbiostat.github.io/MATH130/notes/01c_async_protocol.html) for more details on the course format. -->

## Course structure

This is a flipped classroom. Before set meeting times, students are expected to watch the video lectures. Lectures are all pre-recorded and linked from the class website. During class meeting time, students complete assignments at their own pace and ask the instructor questions when needed.


## Canvas Usage
See the welcome page for your section in Canvas for specific information on how Canvas will be used for your section. 

## Student Support

### Discord 
To facilitate peer to peer and effective instructor to peer assistance Discord will be used for discussion and questions outside of class. This server hosts students across multiple Statistics and Data Science classes, with a specific channel for all sections of Math 130. 

1. Click this link to join the server: https://discord.gg/ck497bJty5
2. Verify your email and agree to the rules and code of conduct. This helps create a safe learning environment.
3. Go to the `#get-roles` text channel in the left sidebar, choose your pronouns (optional but helpful), and click the RStudio icon emoji under the second post to self-assign you to the Math-130 role. this will let you see and access the class channels! More on how to use Discord in week 1. 

### Community Coding. 
Similar to drop in Mathematics tutoring hours, students, staff, faculty, and the public are invited to join our Community Coding sessions. Bring your computer, coding projects, and your questions to this open working environment. For asynchronous sections, this is the best way to get direct instructor assistance.  

* Schedule and info found at https://www.csuchico.edu/datascience/community-coding.shtml 
    
# Learning Outcomes
By the end of the course, students will be able to

* Import data into R from external files such as text files and spreadsheets.
* Calculate summary statistics.
* Create new variables using different data types.
* Perform data management techniques such as filtering, grouping, summarizing.
* Create informative data visualizations and tables.
* Create a reproducible research document.
* Conduct an exploratory data analysis in a reproducible manner.


# Schedule of Topics
The general outline of topics is listed below. A detailed most up to date schedule can be found on the course website.

* Week 1
    - Introduction to the R language and the R Studio Environment
    - Conducting reproducible research with R Markdown
* Week 2
    - How to use functions to get things done
    - Introduction to data processing
* Week 3
    - Univariate Data Visualization using base, and `ggplot2` graphics
    - Streamlined Data processing and Aggregation with `dplyr`
* Week 4
    - Bivariate and Multivariate Data Visualization using `ggplot2`
    - Importing data into R from external files
* Week 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (individual project)


# Required Materials

* A reliable laptop, chromebook, tablet that can use a browser to access the internet.
* Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.

#### Software
If you have your own PC/Mac/*nix computer, you are advised to install  R and R Studio on your personal computer. That way you can take what you've learned in this class and apply it to other classes. Both are free. Walk through installation instructions can be found here: https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/

* R version 4.3.2 or later. Download from https://cran.r-project.org/
* R Studio version 2023.12.0-369 or later. Download the desktop version from https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download

Students who do not have a computer that they install programs on (i.e. a iPad or Chromebook) can use the [Wildcat virtual lab](https://support.csuchico.edu/TDClient/1984/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=112333), or sign up for R Studio Cloud (https://rstudio.cloud/). The free or $5/month plan should be sufficient.  


# Time Commitment

> For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the "credit hour" is defined as ... not less than one hour of classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for one semester or trimester hour of credit.

This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class during these 5 weeks. That's 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of homework per week. If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with computers, you may end up taking the entire time. Be sure to schedule sufficient time during week 5 to work on the project.

You will get out of this class what you put into it. Recall this is just a co-curriculuar or supplemental basic introductory class. You will not learn everything there is to know about R, nor likely not feel proficient by the time you are done. But you will be solidly on the path where you can continue to learn and improve.

# Grading
Credit / No Credit. There are 100 points available in this course. You must earn **75** points to receive credit for the course. See Canvas for instructions on how to submit your work and due dates. 

* Assignments: 4 @ 10 pts each.
* Fill out course notes: 7 @ 5 pts each
* Project:
    - Exploratory Data Analysis (20 pts)
    - Peer Review (5 pts)

# Class Policies and statements

## Everyone is welcome here

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally, or for other students or student groups.

We would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:

* If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Chico records, please let us know!
* If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which may lead to a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address the concerns). 
* If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is 530-898-4764, and email diversityoffice@csuchico.edu
* We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).


_Adapted from [Monica Linden at Brown University](https://www.brown.edu/sheridan/teaching-learning-resources/inclusive-teaching/statements)_.

We acknowledge and are mindful that Chico State stands on lands that were originally occupied by the first people of this area, the Mechoopda, and we recognize their distinctive spiritual relationship with this land, the flora, the fauna, and the waters that run through campus. We are humbled that our campus resides upon sacred lands that since time immemorial have sustained the Mechoopda people and continue to do so today.
