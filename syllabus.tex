\section{Course Description}\label{course-description}}

This course is designed as a primer to get the complete novice up and
running with the basic knowledge of how to use the statistical
programming language R in an environment that emphasizes reproducible
research and literate programming for data analysis. The target audience
is anyone who wants to do their own data analysis. The course will
cumulate with an peer-evaluated exploratory data analysis on either a
pre-specified data set or your data set of choice.

\hypertarget{asynchronous-sections}{%
\subsection{Asynchronous sections}\label{asynchronous-sections}}

At least one section of this class is fully online, asynchronous. This
means there are no set meeting times, but assignments still have due
dates. Lectures are all pre-recorded and linked from the class website.
Students work through the material and complete assignments at their own
pace. See Blackboard learn for more details on the course format.

\hypertarget{discord}{%
\subsubsection{Discord}\label{discord}}

To facilitate peer to peer and effective instructor to peer assistance
Discord will be used for discussion and questions outside of class. This
server hosts students across multiple Statistics and Data Science
classes, with a specific channel for all sections of Math 130.

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Click this link to join the server:
  \url{https://discord.gg/ck497bJty5}
\item
  Verify your email and agree to the rules and code of conduct. This
  helps create a safe learning environment.
\item
  Go to the \texttt{\#get-roles} text channel in the left sidebar,
  choose your pronouns (optional but helpful), and click the RStudio
  icon emoji under the second post to self-assign you to the Math-130
  role. this will let you see and access the class channels! More on how
  to use Discord in week 1.
\end{enumerate}

\hypertarget{community-coding.}{%
\subsubsection{Community Coding.}\label{community-coding.}}

Similar to drop in Mathematics tutoring hours, students, staff, faculty,
and the public are invited to join our Community Coding sessions. Bring
your computer, coding projects, and your questions to this open working
environment. For asynchronous sections, this is the best way to get
direct instructor assistance.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A reliable laptop, chromebook, tablet that can use a browser to access
  the internet.
\item
  Reliable internet connection while on and off campus.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{software}{%
\paragraph{Software}\label{software}}

If you have your own PC/Mac/*nix computer, you are advised to install R
and R Studio on your personal computer. That way you can take what
you've learned in this class and apply it to other classes. Both are
free. Walk through installation instructions can be found here:
\url{https://norcalbiostat.netlify.com/post/software-overview/}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  R version 4.1.0 or later. Download from
  \url{https://cran.r-project.org/}
\item
  R Studio version 1.40 or later. Download the desktop version from
  \url{https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/\#download}
\end{itemize}

Students who do not have a computer that they install programs on
(i.e.~a iPad or Chromebook) can use the
\href{https://support.csuchico.edu/TDClient/1984/Portal/KB/ArticleDet?ID=112333}{Wildcat
virtual lab}, or sign up for R Studio Cloud
(\url{https://rstudio.cloud/}). The free or \$5/month plan should be
sufficient.

\hypertarget{time-commitment}{%
\section{Time Commitment}\label{time-commitment}}

\begin{quote}
For all CSU degree programs and courses bearing academic credit, the
``credit hour'' is defined as \ldots{} not less than one hour of
classroom or direct faculty instruction and a minimum of two hours of
out-of-class student work each week for approximately fifteen weeks for
one semester or trimester hour of credit.
\end{quote}

This adds up to 15 hours in class, and 30 hours outside of class during
these 5 weeks. That's 3 hours in class, and 10 hours of homework per
week. If you are new to programming and unfamiliar with computers, you
may end up taking the entire time. Be sure to schedule sufficient time
during week 5 to work on the project.

You will get out of this class what you put into it. Recall this is just
a co-curriculuar or supplemental basic introductory class. You will not
learn everything there is to know about R, nor likely not feel
proficient by the time you are done. But you will be solidly on the path
where you can continue to learn and improve.

\hypertarget{grading}{%

\hypertarget{everyone-is-welcome-here}{%
\subsection{Everyone is welcome here}\label{everyone-is-welcome-here}}

It is our intent that students from all diverse backgrounds and
perspectives be well-served by this course, that students' learning
needs be addressed both in and out of class, and that the diversity that
the students bring to this class be viewed as a resource, strength and
benefit. It is our intent to present materials and activities that are
respectful of diversity: gender identity, sexuality, disability, age,
socioeconomic status, ethnicity, race, nationality, religion, and
culture. Your suggestions are encouraged and appreciated. Please let us
know ways to improve the effectiveness of the course for you personally,
or for other students or student groups.

We would like to create a learning environment that supports a diversity
of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities
(including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To
help accomplish this:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that
  appear in your official Chico records, please let us know!
\item
  If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by
  your experiences outside of class, please don't hesitate to come and
  talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can
  also submit anonymous feedback (which may lead to a general
  announcement to the class, if necessary to address the concerns).
\item
  If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, the Office
  of Diversity and Inclusion is here to assist. Their number is
  530-898-4764, and email
  \href{mailto:diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}{\nolinkurl{diversityoffice@csuchico.edu}}
\item
  We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about
  diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class
  (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to me about
  it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option).
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, we would like to acknowledge that we are meeting on the
traditional lands of the Mechoopda people. Without them, we would not
have access to this campus or our education.

enrollment at California State University, Chico, and the University's
Academic Integrity Policy requires you to be honest in all your academic
course work. Faculty members are required to report all infractions to
the Office of Student Judicial Affairs. The policy on academic integrity
and other resources related to student conduct can be found on the
Student Judicial Affairs web site at
